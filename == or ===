// In typescript we use two types of Equalities
// "==" This is called Loose Equality.
// "===" This is called Strict Equality.

// Use of Loose Equality.
// It only checks the value even if it is of different type.

5 === "5" // false, because the types are different (number vs. string)
true === 1  // false, because the types are different (boolean vs. number)
null === undefined // false, because they have different types

// Use of Strict Equality.
// It checks the value and even the type.

0 == false // true, because JavaScript converts both to `0`
0 === false // false, because they have different types
"" == false // true, because JavaScript converts the empty string to `0`
"" === false // false, because they have different types

// However, if your running the code in vscode, both react the same.
// But, if your running the code in some browser, they'll react differently.
