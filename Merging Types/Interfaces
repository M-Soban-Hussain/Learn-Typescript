//Now we will see how to extend or merge "type" or "interface".
type Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

type Employee = Person & {
    role: string;
};

const employee: Employee = {
    name: "John",
    age: 30,
    role: "Developer"
};
// In the above example we have extended an existing "type".
// We can also extend "interface".
// We can also extend or merge "typ" and "interface".
