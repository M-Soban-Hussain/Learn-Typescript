// ==================Use of ENUM=====================
// Enum is just like Array but instead of calling the elements via indexes, we use their names.

// Declaration:
// You declare an enum using the enum keyword, followed by the name of the enum and a list of named values enclosed in curly braces.

enum Direction {
  North,
  South,
  East,
  West,
}

// Assigned Values:

// By default, enums are assigned numeric values starting from 0 for the first member and incrementing by 1 for each subsequent member.
// In the example above, Direction.North would have a value of 0, Direction.South would be 1, and so on.

// Custom Values:
// You can explicitly assign custom values to enum members if needed.
// This is useful when you want to control the values associated with each enum member.
// You can also set values like:

enum Color {
  Red = 100,
  Green = 200,
  Blue     // Next would automatically assigned 300, 400 and so on.
}

// Accessing Enum Members:
// You can access enum members using the dot notation. For example, Direction.North or Color.Red.
// You can also access enum members like Color[200].
