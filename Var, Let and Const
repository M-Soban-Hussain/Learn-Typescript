// ==========Uses of let, const and var==============

// "Var" is not blocked-scoped, this means if they are used out side of any block, they may become globally scoped.
// "Let" and "Const" are block-scoped, meaning there use is restricted to the function in which they are declared.
// "Var" and "Let" value can change. It is not permanent. While "Const" value is permanent.
// var myname = 12345;
// console.log(myname);
// const address = "ISLAMABAD";
// console.log(address);
// let age = "18";
// console.log(age);

//My recommendation is to use "Let" as it is not global-scoped and its value can be changed.
