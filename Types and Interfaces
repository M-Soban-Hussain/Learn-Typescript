// In typescript "type" and "interfaces" are used to define custom data types for objects or functions.

// The method for using "type" is as follows :
  type Student = {
      name: string,
      age?: number
  }

// The use of "type" with objects is as follows :
let Soban: Student ={
      name: "M. Soban Hussain",
      age: 18
}

// The method for using "interface" is as follows :
interface AddFunction{
    (a: number,b: number):number
}

// The use of "interface" with function is as follows :
let a,b;
let add: AddFunction =(a,b)=>{
return a + b;
};
console.log(add(3, 9)); // Outputs 7
